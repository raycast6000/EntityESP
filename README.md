# EntityESP
As the name says, you will now be able to see every entity in the world. \
I made this because I've seen some games that deletes all players from the client causing normal ESP scripts to not work.
So this script fixes it.

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raycast6000/EntityESP/main/loader.lua"))()
```
