# EntityESP
As the name says, you will now be able to see every entity in the world. \
I made this because I've seen some games that remove all players from the client side causing normal ESP scripts to not work. \
So this script fixes it.

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raycast6000/EntityESP/main/loader.lua"))()
```
## Notes
- Doesn't work for Phantom Forces (I'm too lazy to actually add compatibility)
- This script is compatible with most FPS games. Also, for normal games like Fencing.
- This is undetectable, don't worry.
## Updates
