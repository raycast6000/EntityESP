# EntityESP (UNC)
An ESP that for entities, or models that contain a Humanoid. \
I made this because I've seen some games that remove all players from the client side causing normal ESP scripts to not work. \
So this script fixes it.

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raycast6000/EntityESP/main/main.lua"))()
```
## Notes
- Doesn't work for Phantom Forces (I'm too lazy to actually add compatibility)
- This script is compatible with most FPS games. Also, for normal games like Fencing.
- This is undetectable.
## Updates
### **Patch** `v1.1`
- I've rewritten the script to make it less stressful for your computer and more readable for everybody.
- Studs labels have been removed (I will add them soon), and same with the name labels.
### **Patch** `v1.0.1`
- The tracers doesn't follow you anymore after dying.
- Studs label no longer stops working after dying.
